# Contracts Unit Tests

To run the python test scripts 
- setup eosfactory framework.(http://eosfactory.io/sphinx/build/html/tutorials/01.InstallingEOSFactory.html)
- Specify the contracts destination folder as "contractPath" in the test scripts
- Run the tests (For example python3 tests/instrumenttest.py)

Currently eosfactory works with v1.0.8 release of eosio.
