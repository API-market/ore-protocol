# Create Bridge - A subsidized account creation contract
It is not trivial to fund account creation on EOS. This contract simplifies the account creation for dapp developers.
So they can focus on developing dapps and not worry about the complexity of account creation.

## Scenario 1
A wallet app wants to onboard new user accounts for a dapp at 20% cost subsidy for first 1000 accounts. It can do this by specifying the above requirements to [createbridge](#Createbridge).
Createbridge also makes sure that the funds are accounted for and only used for the dapp specified by the wallet app. 

## Scenario 2
Developer `A` wants to contribute 50% of RAM cost for new user accounts for a dapp. Developer `B` also wants to contribute 50%.
[createbridge](#Createbridge) enables them to do so by getting 50% cost each from `A` and `B` when it creates the new user accounts.

## Scenario 3
`Block.One` donates some EOS to the community for free account creation. There is no place to do that right now. But with [createbridge](#Createbridge) they can do this and also get an account for where those funds get used.

### Createbridge
`createbridge` is an EOSIO account creator contract that allows dapps to assume portions of the costs for account creation.

As a dapp owner, you can define your dapp with `createbridge` contract specifying the owner/whitelisted account for the app. You can also specify the amount of RAM, NET and CPU you want for the new user accounts. 
As somebody who wants to contribute towards account creation whether it's the dapp owner or any other account, you can send the `createbridge` contract funds with the dapp name and the percentage of RAM you want to subsidize in the memo. These funds will be used to pay for the user account.

Any contributor can reclaim their remaining balance at any point of time.

üëâüèª **Please see the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section for getting started and more detailed explanation of its working here**

## Feature
Taking the lead from the scatter team, we have added some more features:
- Allow only the accounts registered with the dapp to avail the funds contributed for the dapp.
- Easy airdrops of dapp specific tokens with new account creation.
- No risk of loosing your contribution. Reclaim remaining balance at any point of time.
- Easy access to globally available free fund.
- Selection of multiple contributors to maximise the % of RAM cost subsidized for a new account.
- Enables user to specify the total number of accounts to subsidize for a dapp.

### Define your dapp with createbridge

If you are a creator of a dapp, you can define a unique identifier for the dapp and register the `owner` account name for the dapp. 
You can also specify the RAM in bytes, the amount of EOS for NET and CPU (in that order) to give to the new user accounts. 
Also, if you wish to airdrop dapp tokens to the newly created account specify the airdrop contract, total airdrop supply
and the amount to airdrop to every new user account created. 
```
cleos push action createbridge define '[YOUR_ACCOUNT,dapp_name,ram,net,cpu,airdrop_contract,airdrop_tokens,airdrop_limit]'

cleos push action createbridge define '["mydappowner1","mydapp.org","1.0000 EOS","1.0000 EOS","1.0000 EOS","mydapptoken1","1000000.0000 DP","10.0000 DP"]'
```
### Fund createbridge

You can contribute to a dapp by specifying its name, the percentage of RAM cost you want to contribute and the total number of accounts you want to create, separated by comma in the memo field for transfer action.
```
cleos transfer YOUR_ACCOUNT createbridge "token_balance" "dapp_name,ram_percentage,total_accounts"

cleos transfer YOUR_ACCOUNT createbridge "10.0000 EOS" "mydapp.org,50,100"

cleos transfer YOUR_ACCOUNT createbridge "10.0000 EOS" "mydapp.org,100,100"
```

### Create new accounts
To create accounts using funds contributed to a dapp
```
cleos push action createbridge create '["dapp_owner","account_name","owner_key","active_key","dapp_name"]'`

cleos push action createbridge create '["mydappowner1","mydappuser11","EOS4xJvy2tYU21reKbbq4RPLxgzxNmrLtidVWpio5Ggwisfkgzg2L","EOS4xJvy2tYU21reKbbq4RPLxgzxNmrLtidVWpio5Ggwisfkgzg2L","mydapp.org"]'
```

To use globally available free funds
```
cleos push action createbridge create '["memo", "account_name","owner_key","active_key","free"]'
```
```
cleos push action createbridge create '["using free funds","mydappuser12","EOS4xJvy2tYU21reKbbq4RPLxgzxNmrLtidVWpio5Ggwisfkgzg2L","EOS4xJvy2tYU21reKbbq4RPLxgzxNmrLtidVWpio5Ggwisfkgzg2L","free"]'
```

### Whitelist other accounts

You can whitelist other accounts to create accounts on behalf of your dapp.
```
cleos push action createbridge whitelist '[YOUR_ACCOUNT,account_name,dapp_name]'
cleos push action createbridge whitelist '["mydappowner1",account_name,"mydapp.org"]'
```

### Fund createbridge and create accounts in one go
You can contribute to a dapp and create a user account for the dapp at the same time by passing in the dapp name, ram percentage, total accounts (in this case 1), new account name, active key and owner key in order. The remaining balance is refunded back to the contributor after the account creation.

```
cleos transfer YOUR_ACCOUNT createbridge "token_balance" "dapp_name,ram_percentage,total_accounts,account_name,owner_key,active_key"

cleos transfer YOUR_ACCOUNT createbridge "10.0000 EOS" "mydapp.org,100,1,mydappuser13,EOS4xJvy2tYU21reKbbq4RPLxgzxNmrLtidVWpio5Ggwisfkgzg2L,EOS4xJvy2tYU21reKbbq4RPLxgzxNmrLtidVWpio5Ggwisfkgzg2L"
```

### Globally Crowd-Free Accounts

Anyone can send EOS to this contract with the memo __free__ to help fund completely free accounts for new EOS users.
```
cleos transfer YOUR_ACCOUNT createbridge "10.0000 EOS" "free"
```

### Reclaim balance
- As a contributor, you can reclaim your balance at any time.
- You can specify the token symbol of the balance you want to reclaim:
    - Core symbol token to reclaim core symbol balance
    - Dapp token symbol to reclaim the remaining airdrop balance. Only to be reclaimed by the dapp owner
```
cleos push action createbridge reclaim '["YOUR_ACCOUNT","dapp_name","token_symbol"]'

cleos push action createbridge reclaim '["mydappowner1","mydapp.org","EOS"]'

cleos push action createbridge reclaim '["mydappowner1","mydapp.org","DP"]'
```

### Everyone can help!

Because of the way this contract works, anyone can help fund account creation for your app by simply sending amounts
to the contract with the dapp origin inside of the memo.
```
cleos transfer YOUR_ACCOUNT createbridge "10.0000 EOS" "mydapp.org,50"
```

### Quick Start:
- Attach the code level permission to active permission of createbridge
```
cleos set account permission createbridge active '{"threshold": 1,"keys": [{"key": "ACTIVE_KEY","weight": 1}],"accounts": [{"permission":{"actor":"createbridge","permission":"eosio.code"},"weight":1}]}' owner`
```
- Specify the token symbol for the chain and also the contract to call for newaccount action
```
cleos push action createbridge set '["CORE_SYMBOL","NEWACCOUNT_CONTRACT"]'

cleos push action createbridge set '["EOS","eosio"]' -p createbridge
```
